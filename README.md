# molina

Welcome to the `molina` project, a synthetic research asistant for local knowledge representation.

Notice here the absence of the terms `Artificial`, `Intelliget` and similar, this is not an `artificially sweetened` project, is not a claim to be the panacea, neither the $n-th$ attempt to solve general let alone narrow intelligence, because this is definitely not intelligent. It is a tool, built with an agentic approach, for you interact with by the act of formulating research-related questions, which will get you responses using ONLY the academic papers you provide as the knowledge base.

The name is in honor to THE greatest Mexican researcher of all times, [Mario Molina (1943-2020)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Molina_(qu√≠mico)).

## Problem

Challenges of the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), as an academic research assistant, are:  

- Hallucination.
- Lack of domain-specific knowledge.
- Outdated information.
- Bias in Training Data.
- Interpretability and Response Attribution.
